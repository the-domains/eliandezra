# Eli and Ezra's First Encounter

Eli was born on November 28, 2011 just before midnight at 11:50 PM in Room J710 in the East General Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He weighed 7 pounds and 5 ounces (??)

Ezra was born on July 24, 2015 at 5:02 PM in Room J710 in the East General Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He weighed 6 pounds and 10 ounces.

The brothers met in the hallway of the seventh floor of the hospital on July 25, 2015 in the morning.

From that moment, they formed a special bond.
